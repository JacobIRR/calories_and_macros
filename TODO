TODO:

As of 9/3 this works sort of, but is super slow with 13 foods.

1. Try multiprocessing it:

2. Use a yielding recursion strategy instead:

3. Try separating breakfast meals from other meals

4. Make the resulting sets of foods be sorted by their calorie ratios

5. Develop the loops to make a nice friendly output and save it as JSON

6. Once we get back the quantities of servings needed to equal a caloric amount,
    we need to also make meals from the result sets which have a number of servings
    matching nicely with store serving sizes (chicken breast, etc.)
